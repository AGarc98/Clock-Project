# Clock-Project
Project completed in the class CS-210 to create a clock with options
Run Main to launch.
Use keyboard to input commands. 

-The project runs a clock in both formats 12-hour and 24-hour, while also allowing the user to change the time.
-I found a nice way to have the clock running until the user wants to give an input command.
-The place this code needs to be improved is actually tracking the time. After a while the clock desyncs with real time. I think because the 
  way it waits for a second doesnt take into account the time it takes for the main loop to happen. 
-The check to see if there was input took a fair amount of time to figure out and integrate efficiently. I did find a fairly nice way and
  integrated it quite well. I found this method through some forums and then used the documentation to implement it. 
-I think the problem solving aspects of this project will definitely help me in the future as it is such an  integral part of coding. 
  It was also a good introduction to basic interfaces and displaying things in a format.
-I made sure to include good comments in the code and maintained it clean to help with readability.
